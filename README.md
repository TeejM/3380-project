Scheduling System

**IMPORTANT**

The system will look for the file "database.ser" in the current directory (same directory as class files) or in the root project folder in Netbeans. Without this file, it will attempt to create it using the html files in directories existing on my (Taylor's) computer and obviously will not find them.
